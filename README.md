# whim_config

### My Configuration for:

Whim the hackable, pluggable and scriptable dynamic window manager for Windows 10 and 11.

#### Theme: Rose-Pine

My attempt to style whim in the [rose-pine](https://rosepinetheme.com/) theme.

**My Configuration is hugely based on [urob's whim-config](https://github.com/urob/whim-config/tree/main).**
